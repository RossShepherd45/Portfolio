                Hi, I'm Ross Shepherd! This site is where I share the projects I've worked on while learning coding and HTML website development.<br>
                From simple designs to more detailed projects, each one highlights what I've learned and how I'm growing my skills.<br>
                I have enjoyed turning ideas into functional and creative websites, and this portfolio is a way to showcase that progress.<br>
                Thank you so much for visiting, and I hope you enjoy my work!

                I'm a web developer who loves building websites and creating things with code.<br> 
                While I started with HTML and web design, I also enjoy working with Python.
                It's a great language for creating useful tools and solving problems.<br>
                I like to challenge myself by learning new things and trying out different technologies.
                Whether it's building a website or automating tasks with Python,<br> I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills.
